- 👋 Hi, I’m Rodney Morgenstond.
- 👀 I am interested in music, dancing, and exploring new worlds, whether in real life, on the internet, or by trying something new in my general life.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying Data Analytics, it is a new field for me, but I love everything I have learned this far.
- 💞️ I’m looking to work together with like-minded individuals on new projects that can teach me how to be a great data analyst.
- 📫 You can reach me at rmorgenstond@gmail.com
